C++ app that simulates a travel agency.

### 
A travel agency decided to cover two types of tourism: mountain tourism and island tourism.

Every destination has data regarding: 

* the country 
* the city
* the name of the destination
* the price for one day

The destinations also have particularities:
* there are two types of island destinations, either with `sea opening` or with `ocean opening`
* each island destination stores data regarding the `number of islands nearby`
* all mountain destinaions have data about the closest mountain peak, such as `height`, `distance`, `number of tracks`

The destinations can have reviews that contain:
* client's name
* length of stay
* grade (from 1 to 10)

The agency offers three types of discounts: `MountainsDiscount`, `IslandsDiscount`, `PercentileDiscount`.
